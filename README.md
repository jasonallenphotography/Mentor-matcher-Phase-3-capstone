#Mentorship
##Navigating careers can be tricky. Find your way with Mentorship!

#Background
Not everyone is lucky enough to connect with a professional mentor, and those switching careers may not know experienced people in their new chosen field. Our team felt that there was a strong need for a platform to easily connect professionals seeking and offering mentorship.

Through our easy registration process (facilitated by LinkedIn), users can add interests to their profile and reach out to mentors and protégés with shared curiosities, at a company of interest, or in a new geographic market.

Users can request to connect, and once both parties have accepted the connection, a 1:1 conversation is unlocked for them. From here, they can help each other improve on their goals, cultivate and guide talent, and gain insights into new industries!

We hope that our platform provides mutually beneficial mentorship opportunities.

Mentorship is built with Ruby on Rails, LinkedIn's OmniAuth API, PostgreSQL, Javascript (jQuery/AJAX, jQuery UI), and Foundation.
